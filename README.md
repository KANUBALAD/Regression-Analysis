# Regression Model Analysis
Statistics students need to understand how to interpret regression model. With this, i was able to solve questions on regression model accordingly using #Rstats. Kudos to all my Regression lecturers Dr M.k Garuba and Dr W.B Yayah. Kudos to Hadley Wickham the Chief Data Scientist at Rstudio for his book R for datascience that taught me #Rstats
